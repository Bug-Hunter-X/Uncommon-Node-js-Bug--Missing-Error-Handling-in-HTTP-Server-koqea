# Uncommon Node.js Bug: Missing Error Handling in HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in Node.js applications: inadequate error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows a basic HTTP server lacking robust error handling. The `bugSolution.js` provides an improved version incorporating comprehensive error management.

## Problem

Improper error handling can lead to server crashes and unexpected application behavior.  Simple HTTP servers, if not handled correctly, might fail silently or crash upon encountering unexpected issues, resulting in downtime and a poor user experience.

## Solution

Implement `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors within the request handling logic.  Furthermore, listen for 'error' events on the server to catch errors during server initialization and operation.  Always log errors to help with debugging, and return appropriate HTTP error codes to clients when errors occur.
